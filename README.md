## Why open source?

I find value in showcasing how I built my personal website and accept
contributions from others. I also believe each one's brand is identified by
their unique fingerprint, not something that can be easily reproduced.

I found inspiration among many other personal websites, I hope you can find one
here too. However, I also spent many hours and iterations trying to find
something I identified myself with. For that reason, if you decide to use part
of this content, please keep its **attribution** back to
[plourenco.com](https://plourenco.com).
