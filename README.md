🙋‍♂️ My personal website, made in React (<a href="https://plourenco.com">plourenco.com</a>)
</p>

![CI](https://github.com/plourenco/website-blog/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Why open source?

I find value in showcasing how I built my personal website and accept
contributions from others.

I also found inspiration amongst many other personal websites, I hope you can
find one here too. However, I also spent countless hours and iterations trying
to find something I identified myself with. For that reason, if you decide to
copy or re-use this content, design or style, please keep an **attribution**
mention back to [plourenco.com](https://plourenco.com). 😊
